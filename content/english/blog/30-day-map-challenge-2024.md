Similarly to the #30DayChartChallenge in which [we participated in April](https://miraidata.es/en/blog/30-day-chart-challenge-2024/), during November the map community celebrates the #30DayMapChallenge and we have joined in!

The [#30DayMapChallenge](https://30daymapchallenge.com/ "Webpage with the 2024 challenge guidelines") is a challenge that encourages the community to make a map every day of November following a guide that suggests the type of map to be made or the theme to be followed. Participants can join in using the social network of their choice.

Similarly to the #30DayChartChallenge in which we proposed to use only data from *Open Data* of the Generalitat of Catalonia, we established that in this case the maps could only be of Catalonia, Maresme or Matar√≥.

Here are the maps we made during the challenge, **hope you like them!
