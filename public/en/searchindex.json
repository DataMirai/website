  "content":"Definitions matter as much as the outcomes themselves. Because\u0026hellip; What happens when those outcomes directly affect people\u0026rsquo;s wallets? This is where the each one\u0026rsquo;s fire really comes to the surface and burns even a mother if need to. When we have to make certain statistical readings to understand a situation, we must pay more attention even to the context of the numbers than to the numbers themselves. This is where statistics becomes a battleground, and experimental design a weapon loaded with legal, ethical and economic implications. Ideas before numbers.\nPlaying with math is relatively easy and the impact and interpretation is immediately understood. On any given problem, when analysed with a mean or median, our conclusions about the study population change. It changes the narrative. Completely. This is in fact ‘intuitive’ and very quickly apparent. It is intuitive precisely because the definitions of mean and median are well defined and accepted. It is not for nothing that there are \u0026rsquo;numbers\u0026rsquo; people. People who do not ride contradictions.\nIt gets much more complicated when you play with the definition of the numbers to be used in the calculations. If manipulating the calculations changes the story, manipulating the definitions changes the entire paradigm.\nTip\nThis project can continue thanks to our patrons. If you also want to collaborate you can do it here .\nA sandbox example: Consider a company with 100 employees, including 3 directors. The company is located in a region where the average cost of living is around €20,000.\nThe end of the financial year is approaching and it is time to do the maths. The company itself has not done badly. But there is a lot of discontent. The employees, organised in unions, report that their salaries are not enough to cover the basics, while the company generates very high profits. The headlines spread like wildfire: ‘Evil company accused of enslaving employees’. Protests begin to threaten the company\u0026rsquo;s image.\nBoard of directors crunches the numbers:\nProfit: €750,000 to be split between 3; €250,000 for each director. Directives salary: €50,000 per director (3 directors). Salary for each employee: €15,500 per employee (97 employees). How much is the total salary paid? A simple weighted average will tell; 3 directors and 97 employees.\nweighted.mean(c(50000,15500),c(3,97)) [1] 16535 The company reports in official figures an average salary of €16,535. This is a problem for the public eye, as the salary paid by the company does not cover the €20,000 cost of living for employees located in the company\u0026rsquo;s region. All this, remembering that the directors take a total of €300,000 in profits.\nThe press and the major labour unions attack with the argument that the average wage does not cover the region\u0026rsquo;s expenses. They are absolutely right, but they make a mistake. They rely solely on the company\u0026rsquo;s own reported figure being correct. They don\u0026rsquo;t care about that definition. The company realises this and they play their card trick.\nAs they are only being attacked by the average wage, they decide to change the compensation form. Benefits are now paid as part of the directors\u0026rsquo; salaries. This kills two birds with one stone: they lower the benefits and increase the average salary on top of that, whitening their image.\nThey will not be able to put all the profits into the directors\u0026rsquo; salaries, as some things cannot be done legally, but the magic of fiscal engineering will make most of the transfer possible.\nBoard of directors crunches the numbers again with \u0026ldquo;fiscal magic\u0026rdquo;:\nProfit: €33,333 for each director. Now only €100,000 in total. Directives salary: €266,666 in total (€50,000 original + €216,666 ‘profit’). Salary of each employee: €15,500 per employee. They leave it exactly the same. (750000-100000)/3 [1] 216666.7 How much is now the new total wage paid? Again with the weighted average:\nweighted.mean(c(266666,15500),c(3,97)) [1] 23034.98 What a pleasant surprise. An average worker now earns €23,034. The narrative now is that the company has had very low profits, and that it is looking out for its employees, has raised the average wage to the point where all employees are now paid more and that there may be turbulence in times to come, so we can take advantage and lay off staff who do not meet the criteria to maximise even more profits. What could they complain about?\nBy changing the narrative through numbers, the company has removed the big brother who sees all and judges all. Numbers, the champions of objectivity, are nothing more than abstractions of people\u0026rsquo;s ideas.\nWhen the example comes to life But hey! It\u0026rsquo;s all laughs and procrastination in isolated examples without context. So let\u0026rsquo;s put some reality into the matter, while saving certain differences.\nIn the 1990s, Nike was in a period of great global expansion, establishing itself as one of the leading brands in the sports industry.\nNike, like other major global brands, implemented a production model based on outsourcing. Nike outsourced production to factories in developing countries, where labour costs were considerably lower.\nMoving production always leaves dissatisfaction, especially for a global brand with high visibility. Nike faced the risk of various types of criticism, both economic from the abandoned locations and ethical in its global supply chain. In order to protect its image, Nike demanded that its subcontracted factories meet certain standards.\nAmong these standards was meeting decent worker pay, but keeping costs extremely low. Nike negotiated very tight prices for products, leaving factories with ‘minimal’ profit margins. However, fierce competition among suppliers was unleashed. Foreign factories, especially in Vietnam and Thailand, competed with each other for Nike contracts.\nNike\u0026rsquo;s strategy seemed perfect. Not only did it whitewash its image in the eyes of the public, avoiding accusations of exploitation by ensuring that it maintained ‘living wages’, but it also avoided the emergence of strong competition by leaving very low profit margins to the franchised companies. However, of course, Nike was not the only one with ‘big ideas’. As they say, for every law there is a loophole.\nMany of the factories subcontracted by Nike relied on malpractice to meet standards and gain the favour of being Nike franchises. One of the most common was the manipulation of wage reports. In order to appear to meet labour standards for worker wages, factories inflated wage averages. This distorted the metrics as wage categories were mixed up in the calculations. Managers, supervisors and administrative staff, whose wages were significantly higher than those of production line workers, were counted in the average wage calculations.\nThis way, the factories were ‘making up’ the figures, maintaining the narrative that their core workers were very well paid, when the reality was that wages for workers were extremely low, often insufficient to cover even basic needs in developing countries.\nMoreover, audits by Nike or local authorities rarely detected these manipulations. Inspections were often sporadic or superficial, and factories knew how to prepare themselves to appear compliant. Even in countries with stricter labour laws, corruption and lack of effective regulation helped perpetuate these practices.\nBehind this system, factory workers were trapped in exploitative working conditions. Low wages, long hours, unsafe working environments and a lack of union representation were the standard. This model not only revealed the structural flaws of the industry, but also demonstrated how large global corporations could profit from a system that privileged profit margins over workers\u0026rsquo; welfare.\nIn the end, several organisations echoed the facts. The NGO Oxfam, in its article [‘Sweatshop wages and unpaid care work’] (https://www.oxfam.org/en/press-releases/sweatshop-wages-and-unpaid-care-work-double-burden-asias-women-its-economy-booms ‘Oxfam article’), exposed in detail the precarious working conditions in subcontracted factories, highlighting the manipulation of wage reports. Their research, along with campaigns by other organisations such as Global Exchange, helped to make these practices visible and generate significant public pressure on Nike.\nThe actions were successful, and Nike finally decided to rethink its labour model and policies. In particular, it strengthened audits and outsourced the process in order to maintain rigorous control of compliance.\nHowever, the Nike case in the 1990s remains an emblematic example of the ethical and social dilemmas of what manipulation in the calculation of a figure such as a salary can involve.\n"},{

  "content":"In this post I am going to tell you a short anecdote that happened to me recently. But we have to go back to 2020 to find its beginning.\nTip\nThis project can continue thanks to our patrons. If you also want to collaborate you can do it here .\nIn 2020, the lockdown brought many neighbourhoods closer and encouraged residents to ‘make a community’. It was around that time that many agreed to hang a banner on their balcony with the slogan ‘Enough is enough! For a safe Mataró’ (Mataró is my city).\nBanner in a window in Mataró.\rWas the problem really that serious? At the beginning of 2021 I decided to make a request to public information access and literally asked for: \u0026ldquo;data on reports in Mataró from 2015 to 2020, by type of crime, detailed by neighbourhood and with the sex and age of the person reported\u0026rdquo;. So far so good, let\u0026rsquo;s see what we could get from this data.\nThe excel arrived within a month. Doing a quick analysis, I saw that between 2015 and 2019 there was an average of 2,200 complaints per year, with the exception of 2020, where the numbers shot up to 3,700 reports. What was going on here?\nI was quite surprised to see that almost half of the 2020 reports were due to (drum roll) reports made against people who had skipped lockdown! Taking out that excess, the reality of the 2020 data was pretty much the same as in previous years.\nLucky or not (more lucky than unlucky, I\u0026rsquo;ll tell you), the project end up on stand by until 2022. But the complaints from the neighbours persisted and I decided to take up the project again, asking for the 2021 data with the same variables and the same description.\nThere was nothing too remarkable in the new file I received: this time, according to the data, there had been 2,600 reports in 2021. Slightly more than in previous years, but for a city of 130,000 inhabitants that rate seemed to be low.\nAgain, due to life\u0026rsquo;s circumstances, I left the project on the back burner and it is only now, in 2024, that I have taken up again what I had left behind.\nIn order to keep the \u0026rsquo;now\u0026rsquo; factor, I asked again for the updated data from 2020 to 2023. I asked for the data for 2020 and 2021 even though I already had it to be able to check, for example, if the name of any type of crime had changed or if the numbers were very different. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have to lift a finger to realise that the data was completely different.\nHow far behind the ‘skyrocketing’ 3,700 reports in 2020 in the previous dataset were that the updated data showed that in 2020 there had been 7,500 reports and the fines from the confinement were no longer included. On top of that, the trend was rising year on year at a much more significant rate than what was shown in the other dataset. While in the previous data we had a difference of tens or hundreds of reports from year to year, in the new data there was a clear upward trend that was growing by hundreds or thousands.\nThe only difference in the new dataset was that here I had been given the data in two separate excel tabs: one with the crimes in each neighbourhood and the other tab with the profile of the reported people. Without any possibility of joining one data with the other as I had in the previous dataset.\nMy first reaction was to think that they had given me the wrong data, because out of the 3 times I had asked for it, 2 of them matched and one didn\u0026rsquo;t. That same afternoon I went to visit the Mossos d\u0026rsquo;Esquadra (catalan police) and they told me they didn\u0026rsquo;t know anything about it, but that the numbers that matched the most for them were those of the last dataset.\nSpecial mention should be made of the sentence I was told: ‘We have just started the shift and we have made 14 reports, it is impossible that in a year you only get 2,000.\nKnowing then that the data that was wrong was the old one, I made another request with the reports from 2016 to 2023, asking explicitly that the data of the reported people should not be in a separate table.\nTo my surprise (or at this point to nobody\u0026rsquo;s surprise), a new dataset arrived completely different from the previous ones. Now the average number of reports was not around the 2,000 per year of the first dataset or the 8,000 of the second. Now I was faced with data that said there were 1,500 reports on average every year.\nAt least this time the profile of those reported was in the same row as the offences for which they had been reported. They had also added the column ‘Origin’, even though I had not explicitly asked for it.\nBy now the more astute of you will have realised what was going on. A nice man from the Conselleria d\u0026rsquo;Interior had to explain it to me over the phone after I had made a complaint asking for explanations.\nIt turns out that in their logic there is no such thing as a dataset with NAs. If a row has any NAs, they remove it from the dataset before giving it to you. So, the solution of the mystery is that the first dataset only contained the reports in which the sex and age of the reported people were known, and the last one had to fulfill the variables Sex, Age and also Origin. That is why there were fewer rows.\nIn the one with an average of 8,000 reports per year, as they had separated the information into two tabs, the number of reports had not been affected too much and, as the Mossos said, it is the one that is closest to reality (although the open data of the Mossos shows higher numbers, possibly they have also applied another filter and have sent me only the cases in which the neighbourhood of the crime is known).\nSo, to answer the question in the title ‘Are public administrations’ data reliable? It depends. After all, the data they sent me was correct. The error was that it was incomplete. If I had asked for it explicitly with the NAs, would they have sent it to me complete? I have yet to check that, but I hope so. Have they created a certain degree of mistrust? Absolutely, there\u0026rsquo;s no reason to deny it.\nFrom now on, we will have to do our work better: we will have to write more detailed requests and check the data by other means. Especially because very few of them come with documentation or metadata, so the conclusions of the analyses often come from our assumptions of what the data represent, which should not happen.\nWhat is really important is to know the context of what we want to cover and to see if the data is reflecting reality, and if it is not, to look for what is going on. That is the job of a data analyst or a data journalist and at Mirai Data we want to do our job well!\n"},{

  "content":"This year we actively participated in the #30DayChartChallenge and here are the results!\nTip\nThis project can continue thanks to our patrons. If you also want to collaborate you can do it here .\nThe #30DayChartChallenge is a challenge that encourages the community to make a data visualisation every day of April following a guide that indicates the type of chart to make or the theme to follow. Participants can join in using the social network of their choice.\nBesides this, I decided to use the Dades Obertes datasets of the Generalitat de Catalunya whenever there was data related to the theme of the day. The good thing about this is that almost all the datasets are documented and clean, so I had to spend little time cleaning the data and I could focus on the design of the visualisations.\nTo my surprise, Datawrapper added one of my graphs in a blog post about \u0026ldquo;the best data visualisations of the week\u0026rdquo;.\nEnjoy the visualisations I published for the challenge. I hope you like them!\n"}]
