  "content":"This year we actively participated in the #30DayChartChallenge and here are the results!\nTip\nThis project can continue thanks to our patrons. If you also want to collaborate you can do it here .\nThe #30DayChartChallenge is a challenge that encourages the community to make a data visualisation every day of April following a guide that indicates the type of chart to make or the theme to follow. Participants can join in using the social network of their choice: in my case, I chose to share the visualisations on my Twitter, Linkedin, Mastodon and Bsky profiles.\nBesides this, I decided to use the Dades Obertes datasets of the Generalitat de Catalunya whenever there was data related to the theme of the day. The good thing about this is that almost all the datasets are documented and clean, so I had to spend little time cleaning the data and I could focus on the design of the visualisations.\nI confess it was quite an experience since I hadn\u0026rsquo;t spent time doing data visualisations for a long time. To my surprise, Datawrapper added one of my graphs in a blog post about \u0026ldquo;the best data visualisations of the week\u0026rdquo;. This encouraged me to keep dedicating time and effort to learn new things for the rest of the month.\nI was able to catch up on all the new features that I had not been able to try out until then due to lack of time. Now that I\u0026rsquo;m up to date with R, it\u0026rsquo;s time to focus on content and continue making interesting visualisations for all ages.ðŸ¤—\nMeanwhile, you can enjoy the visualisations I published for the challenge. I hope you like them!\n"},{
